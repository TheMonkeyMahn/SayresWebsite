    <a href="https://sh1mmer.me" target="_blank">SH1MMER</a>
    <p>Sh1mmer is a tool to exploit a Chromebook's recovery system to allow the user to unenroll school devices.</p>
    <p>What you need: A usb stick with at least 8GB of storage, a non school-enrolled laptop (prefferably Windows), and patience.</p><br>
    <p>First step: On your school-enrolled Chromebook, go to <a href="chrome://version" target="_blank">chrome://version</a> and find the word after "stable-channel". Go to <a href="https://sh1mmer.me" target="_blank">sh1mmer.me</a>. Scroll down and go to the link that says <a href="https://files.ultimatesrv.com/" target="_blank">"files.ultimatesrv.com"</a> and download the corresponding file that goes with that one word. If your file isn't there, you're out of luck. Sorry.</p>
    <p>For some reason, that first .BIN file takes over an hour to download (for me at least) so just do something while that file is downloading.</p>
    <p>Second step: click "sh1mmer web builder", scroll down, click start, and then upload that .BIN file from earlier. This process is quick, so you can just wait.</p>
    <p>Once that file's downloaded, install the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chromebook-recovery-utili/pocpnlppkickgojjlmhdmidojbmbodfm" target="_blank">ChromeBook Recovery Utility Extension</a>. After that's installed, go the extensions section of Chrome (the puzzle piece in the top right corner of the browser), and open the extension.</p>
    <p>Click the settings button in the top right corner of the extensions window and select "Use Local Image". Insert the USB drive. Upload the modified shim file (the second one) and wait about 10 minutes.</p>
    <p>Once this process is finished, enter recovery mode on your ChromeBook by pressing ↻, escape, and then the power button. **THIS STEP WILL CLEAR YOUR DEVICE'S DATA. TO GO BACK, HOLD THE POWER BUTTON.** Press ctrl+d on that screen and then press enter.</p>
    <p>This step's important, once you've pressed crtl+d and then enter, press ↻, escape and then power again. Insert the USB drive into your school-enrolled ChromeBook.</p>
    <p>If it worked, Sh1mmer will open. To unenroll, press the down arrow, enter and you will be in the tools section of Sh1mmer. Press the down arrow again, then enter. Once the process has finished, do whatever else you want to, and then press backspace, and then "Boot ChromeOS"</p>
    <p>Log into the ChromeBook using whatever account you want to, (if you use your school account, you can use guest mode) and have fun!</p>
